# Features

This document lists what the server can do, and where each capability comes from. Some of it is UltraRAG, some is built on top of UltraRAG, and some is only planned. It also compares this server with a different, more general MCP RAG server, because "which one should I use?" depends on the job.

Three labels are used throughout:

- **UltraRAG** — the capability comes from the upstream framework this project pins, and this server uses it as it is.
- **Added here** — the research layer around UltraRAG. This is where most of the product lives.
- **Planned** — described in `ROADMAP.md` or `TODO.md`, not built yet. Nothing in this document claims otherwise.

For measurements behind the performance-related features, see `MEASUREMENTS.md`. For how to use them, see `README.md`. Where UltraRAG offers a capability that this server does not use, the reason and what the upstream component would have added are recorded in section 1.1: an unused upstream feature here is a documented decision, not an oversight.

## 1. What UltraRAG provides, and what this server uses

UltraRAG is much larger than the part this server needs. Its gateway exposes around 78 tools and 26 prompts across corpus, retrieval, reranking, prompt, generation, routing, memory, benchmark, and evaluation components, with several vector-database backends and an upstream web interface.

This server deliberately uses only three upstream capabilities, and owns everything else itself:

| UltraRAG capability | Used here? | What this server does with it |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-2 token chunking (`corpus_chunk_documents`) | Yes | Splits extraction units into token chunks with a configured size and overlap. Several units share one call for speed; each unit still gets its own durable output. |
| BM25 lexical index and search (`retriever_retriever_init`, `retriever_bm25_index`, `retriever_bm25_search`) | Yes | Supplies the lexical half of retrieval, in English, on CPU. |
| FAISS, Qdrant and Milvus dense index backends (`retriever_init(index_backend=...)`) | No | The dense path is built here instead: FastEmbed CPU embeddings plus either an exact scan of the generation's portable vectors or an embedded Qdrant collection created with the same pinned `qdrant-client` library, chosen per generation and recorded in its manifest. See section 1.1. |
| Reranking components (`reranker_init`, `reranker_rerank`) | No | A FastEmbed CPU cross-encoder reorders at most 50 candidates and keeps its scores. See section 1.1. |
| Prompt assembly and answer generation | No | The connected agent generates. The server returns evidence, not prose. See section 1.2. |
| Routing, memory, benchmark, evaluation components | No | Not part of this server's contract. Retrieval-quality evaluation is planned as its own work (see section 4 and section 1.2). |
| Web-search retrieval | No | Out of scope: this server answers from a project's own documents only. See section 1.2. |
| Upstream web interface | No | This server ships its own local UI for its own seven tools. See section 1.3. |

Three consequences are worth stating plainly.

First, **the chunker and BM25 are upstream, but the parameters and the surrounding policy are not**: chunk size, overlap, which units are chunked, how results are filtered, and what is disclosed about rejected text are all decided here.

Second, **pinning a small upstream surface is a feature, not a gap**. It means an UltraRAG upgrade can be evaluated against three well-understood call sites instead of dozens, and that this server never depends on an upstream service, credential, GPU, or vector database being available.

Third, **every capability marked No in the table above has a recorded reason**. Each one is either replaced by a component whose output the research contract can use (section 1.1) or left out deliberately (sections 1.2 and 1.3).

### 1.1 Reuse decisions: when this server builds a component instead of reusing one

The rule applied here is to reuse an upstream component whenever it can satisfy the research contract without adding a dependency or an operational requirement this project refuses to take. That contract needs, for every hit, a stable `chunk_id`, `document_id`, and `source_id`; a locator into the original file; query-time metadata filtering resolved against the reviewed overlay; a visible ranking signal; and CPU-only, offline-capable, credential-free operation in which no external service is required. A component is replaced only when at least one of those cannot be met.

Any decision below would be revisited if the upstream component gained all four of the following.

- It returns identifiers and a score, not only anonymous passage text.
- It filters by metadata at query time, using values the server can verify against canonical records rather than copies baked into an index.
- It runs on CPU, offline, pinned by revision, with no server, GPU, or API credential.
- It can be validated as one index of an immutable generation, so a failed index can never be selected.

**FAISS (`retriever_init(index_backend="faiss")`, `servers/retriever/src/index_backends/faiss_backend.py`).**

- **Benefit if reused:** a mature, in-process CPU index with no server, less custom code to maintain, and alignment with the backend upstream's own Vanilla RAG pipeline uses.
- **Why not:** its `search()` returns `List[List[str]]` built from `self.contents[doc_id]`, so chunk identity and scores are discarded and no metadata filter exists, which means reviewed category or keyword filters could only be applied by copying mutable metadata into the index or by dropping hits after the fact; the index is also built from the corpus during `retriever_init` and rebuilt over the whole corpus, which costs 3,040.73 s for the reference corpus on the project's HDD and 75.5× less on NVMe (`MEASUREMENTS.md`), while the exact scan the server uses instead costs 0.07 s of index work.
- **What replaced it:** an exact cosine scan of the generation's portable float32 vectors, whose descriptor builds in 0.03 s and 0.58 MB on the reference corpus and returned the same top 20 as a brute-force ranking; rows are excluded by document ID during the scan, so an exclusion or a reviewed metadata change takes effect without rebuilding anything.
- **Threshold:** the exact scan is the default; an ANN backend earns its build cost only above 200,000 chunks, and there the embedded Qdrant backend is preferred because it returns scored hits under a payload filter, which the upstream FAISS component cannot do.

**Qdrant (`retriever_init(index_backend="qdrant")`, `servers/retriever/src/index_backends/qdrant_backend.py`).**

- **Benefit if reused:** the payload filtering and scored results this server wants, delivered by the same `qdrant-client` library it already depends on.
- **Why not:** the upstream component's `search()` returns only the payload text field (`str((hit.payload or {}).get(self.text_field, ""))`) and discards ids and scores, assigns `uuid5` point IDs derived from values instead of canonical chunk IDs, and creates its collection at init. The library is reused; the component is not.
- **Benefit of the reuse that does happen:** this server's own thin backend stores integer point IDs with `chunk_id`, `document_id`, and `source_id` as payload, applies Qdrant's `MatchAny` payload filter to the document IDs the service already resolved from the reviewed overlay, and returns `point.score` as a ranking signal.
- **Threshold:** selected per generation only above 200,000 chunks and recorded in that generation's manifest; below that, the exact scan is both simpler and faster.

**Milvus (`retriever_init(index_backend="milvus")`, `servers/retriever/src/index_backends/milvus_backend.py`).**

- **Benefit if reused:** a server-grade, horizontally scalable vector database with multi-client access, which is genuinely useful for a shared collection far larger than this project targets.
- **Why not:** it needs a running Milvus service, or Milvus Lite, alongside the process, which conflicts with portable project-local derived state, the no-external-service rule, and the 5,000–50,000 chunk design envelope; its `search()` also returns passage strings only. Upstream itself logs a warning that using Milvus outside demo mode is not recommended in its simplified architecture, and its demo mode forces OpenAI embeddings with Milvus, which adds a network credential on top.
- **Why the workload does not need it:** at the reference corpus size the exact scan answers a query in tens of milliseconds from vectors the generation already stores, so a vector database would add an operational dependency without adding a capability.

**Reranking components (`reranker_init`, `reranker_rerank`, `servers/reranker`).**

- **Benefit if reused:** upstream's reranker model catalogue, including `openbmb/MiniCPM-Reranker-Light` as its shipped default, and consistency with the upstream pipeline.
- **Why not:** every upstream backend adds something this project refuses. The `sentence_transformers` backend pulls PyTorch into a package that otherwise needs only ONNX Runtime; the `infinity` backend is a model-serving engine; the `openai` backend needs a network credential and would send research queries to a third party; and upstream's shipped parameters target `device: cuda`. Its result is also `rerank_psg` — reordered passage strings with the scores discarded.
- **Why scores matter here:** the server reorders at most 50 candidates by score and then appends the unreranked candidate tail, so a reference group can still reach a source whose best passage fell outside the reranked prefix; a string-only reranker cannot express that ordering.
- **Why the gateway cannot be asked for it:** `reranker` is one of the stateful namespaces the vanilla gateway can start, but the research transport requests `corpus` and `retriever` only, so no reranker child process runs today and adding one would add a second model-serving surface.
- **What replaced it:** a FastEmbed cross-encoder through the already-pinned FastEmbed ONNX dependency and the same shared model cache, lazily loaded, applied to at most 50 candidates, and chosen by the engine rather than by the caller. Six of FastEmbed's registered cross-encoders are supported, each pinned to a revision in `rerankers.py`, with `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` as the default; a name outside that table is refused instead of being resolved to whatever the model hub serves that day.
- **Measured benefit of the custom component, and its default:** on the judged set, reranked hybrid reaches 81.2% first-position success against 65.6% unreranked and 59.4% for BM25, at 2.30 s per query against 0.17 s. It is therefore the server's fixed behavior, with `rerank=false` reachable only from the engine (the harness and the tests) and a disclosed fallback to the unranked order when its model cannot be loaded. `MEASUREMENTS.md` records how the supported models compare on the same judged set.

The net position is narrower than it may look. These are not weaker technologies, and none of the decisions is permanent: the Qdrant library is already reused, the reranker is a pinned model whose revision is a one-line change, and an upstream component that returned identity and scores under a CPU-friendly backend would be adopted rather than rebuilt. What this server will not do is trade chunk identity, ranking signals, query-time filtering, or local-only operation for the sake of delegating to an upstream class.

### 1.2 Capabilities that are left out instead of replaced

These upstream components have no custom replacement, because adopting them would change what the server is rather than how it is built.

- **Prompt assembly and answer generation.** Adopting upstream's prompt and generation components would add a model-serving or API dependency and move prose generation into the server. The contract instead has the connected agent write the answer and cite returned evidence, which is why `search` returns structured passages with provenance rather than an answer string.
- **Routing, memory, benchmark, and evaluation.** These serve multi-corpus pipelines, conversational memory, and benchmark scoring with boxed answers. This server is one project, one corpus, and one immutable generation, and retrieval quality is measured offline against a judged query set rather than by an upstream evaluation component.
- **Web-search retrieval.** It would send a researcher's query to a third-party provider and mix outside text into evidence that must be traceable to a project source, so retrieval stays inside the project's own documents.

### 1.3 The upstream web interface

The upstream interface is bound to upstream pipeline and session state, and it exposes tools this server deliberately does not. The bundled local UI is a pinned, dependency-free browser workspace that talks to the same seven public MCP tools through the private stdio client, is bound to loopback, and may serve only an allowlisted original PDF or EPUB. Reusing the upstream interface would mean either exposing the upstream surface through this server or maintaining a second, divergent view of the same project.

## 2. Features added on top of UltraRAG

### Ingestion and text quality

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| PDF and EPUB ingestion | Walks the source directory recursively and accepts regular `.pdf` and `.epub` files only. | Other formats are ignored on purpose, so a stray `notes.md` never enters the knowledge base. |
| Layout-aware extraction | Reads PDFs page by page and EPUBs by spine section, keeping structure and discarding repeated page furniture. | Reading order and paragraphs survive; running headers do not become fake content. |
| Original-file locators | Every unit and chunk points back to a PDF page (with the printed page label when available) or an EPUB section. | You can open the source and check the passage. Locators are navigation aids, not quote offsets. |
| Bibliographic metadata with provenance | Resolves title, authors, year, DOI, and language per document, recording where each value came from and any warnings. Language detection reads the source's own function words against the stopword lists BM25 knows, and answers nothing when a sample is too short or no list is covered. | Automatic metadata is provisional: an answer carries only the authors it resolved, while the full-detail payload carries the citation that uses the metadata, the per-field provenance, and the warnings that flag a value needing review. |
| Reviewed metadata overlay | Corrections saved outside the generation apply at the next read to listings, filters, citations, search results, and neighbouring passages. The file is plain JSON and hand-editable at any time; `set_source_metadata`, and the UI dialog built on it, write the same file one source at a time so a hand edit and a save cannot clobber each other. | Fixing a wrong author does not require re-ingesting, does not rewrite immutable data, and needs no agent. |
| Corrupt-text rejection with disclosure | Rejects a page or section only when its text shows strong evidence of a broken character map, then reports reason codes, counts, and example chunk IDs. | Bad text leaves the index, and you are told what was removed rather than silently losing material. |
| Script mixing never withholds | A quotation in Greek, Cyrillic, or any other script stays retrievable and its text is returned unchanged; the advisory script note stays in the full-detail payload. | English-language scholarship quotes other languages; withholding those passages was a real defect that this fixes. |
| Targeted normalisation folding | Formula-font letters (`𝑀` becomes `M`) and the presentation ligatures `ﬁ`, `ﬂ`, and `ﬀ` fold to plain spellings. Accents, superscripts, subscripts, and symbols are left alone. | A typed query matches printed text, without destroying notation that carries meaning. |
| Symbol-only chunk exclusion | Nonempty chunks containing no letters or digits are dropped. | Extraction artefacts do not pollute results, while numbers and formulas are unaffected. |
| Embedding-token audit | Every chunk records its embedding token count and whether its vector covers only a prefix. | Silent truncation becomes visible per hit and in aggregate instead of quietly degrading dense search. |
| Contextual chunk headers | `chunking.headers` prepends the source's title and section to the text a chunk is embedded from, and never to the text a search returns. Off by default: a rebuild of the PDF reference corpus measured no change, so a project opts in. It is an identity setting, so it is a rebuild rather than a live switch. | A passage cannot state which work and which section it came from, and that is exactly what a question about a work or a chapter is asking for; the returned text stays quotable as it stands. |
| Compatible-material reuse | Unchanged documents keep their extracted units and chunks; identical chunk text keeps its vector. | Adding one source costs a fraction of a rebuild. |
| Resumable ingestion | Long builds are checkpointed; a call that exceeds its soft time budget returns `in_progress` and you repeat it. Cancellation, timeout, and restart lose at most one bounded batch. | A rebuild of a large collection does not have to succeed in one sitting. |
| Explicit regeneration | `force_recompute` bypasses all reuse while still resuming its own checkpoint. | You can rebuild from scratch deliberately rather than by accident. |

### Retrieval

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| BM25 lexical search (UltraRAG) | Matches the words you typed. | Exact names, terms, and phrases. Also the honest baseline when a semantic result surprises you. |
| Dense semantic search (added here) | FastEmbed `bge-small-en-v1.5` embeddings, 384 dimensions, CPU, revision-pinned. | Finds passages phrased differently from your question. |
| Hybrid search (UltraRAG plus added here) | Weighted reciprocal-rank fusion of the two rankings, with an opt-out to inspect either signal alone. | The default that behaves well on real questions: 65.6% first-position success on the judged set, against 59.4% for BM25 alone. |
| Exact dense scan by default (added here) | Dense search scans the generation's portable float32 vectors directly; an embedded index is used above a documented corpus size. The manifest records which backend built the generation. | Nothing to build or keep in sync at normal sizes, and results are exactly reproducible. |
| Metadata filters (added here) | Narrow by project, category, keyword, or document, and see the project and category inventories in `status`. | Keeps a search inside the part of the collection you care about. |
| Source selection (added here) | `source_ids` includes and `exclude_source_ids` removes named sources by their stable ID; both default to empty, which means include everything and exclude nothing. Filters apply before ranking, so `top_k` is a budget inside the selection. | A query can be confined to, or kept away from, specific works without a second corpus or a new generation. |
| Corpus partitions by branch (added here) | `categories_any` requires at least one of the listed branches, resolved from reviewed metadata at query time; `status.categories` reports each branch with its searchable source count. | One corpus can be searched as several parts — branches, strands, sub-projects — and the partitioning is reviewable metadata, not an index-time decision. |
| Project layer (added here) | `project` records which project a source was gathered for; `projects_any` requires at least one of the listed tags, and `status.projects` reports each tag with its searchable source count. | A corpus stays self-describing when it is exported as a bundle, imported elsewhere, or shared between projects, and a search can be confined to the sources gathered for one project. |
| Narrowing by source and metadata (added here) | `source_ids` and `exclude_source_ids` include or remove named sources, and `projects_any`, `categories_any`, and `keywords` narrow by reviewed metadata before ranking. | One prolific book chapter cannot fill the answer. |
| Per-source language, filterable (added here) | Every source carries the language extraction detected and the language a review set instead, and `languages_any` keeps results written in any of the listed ISO 639 codes. `status.languages` inventories them with each language's searchable source count. | A corpus in more than one language can be partitioned and searched per language, without pretending BM25 can filter two stopword lists at once. |
| Reranking, always on (added here) | A CPU cross-encoder reorders up to 50 fused candidates; when its pinned model cannot be loaded the search returns the unranked order and reports `rerank_fallback`. | The largest measured quality gain: first-position success rises from 65.6% to 81.2% and document-level success from 90.6% to 93.8%, for about thirteen times the query latency of unreranked hybrid — and a missing model degrades instead of failing. |
| Source diversity in the final selection (added here) | `retrieval.source_diversity_penalty` charges a candidate a share of its normalized relevance for every candidate already taken from the same source, applied at the final `top_k` pick over candidates fusion and reranking already ranked. It can only reorder, never add or drop a candidate; a bare BM25 or dense ranking has no score to charge against and keeps its own order. | Four of thirty judged top-10 answers came from a single source with the charge off. The default 0.25 leaves no one-source answer and lifts the mean distinct sources from 3.9 to 7.4, while every success column, MRR, nDCG, and document success stay within one query's rank. |
| Measured retrieval quality (added here) | A 32-query judged set over 19 passages of a real corpus and a harness that measures each retrieval mode through the engine the tool calls, reported per mode and per query class. | "Is hybrid better than BM25 here?" is answered by measurement: reranking gains most, dense alone is weakest, and paraphrase queries defeat every mode. |
| Honest evaluation limits (added here) | The judged set is known-item and single-annotator, so a passage that makes the same point is scored as a miss and true recall is not claimed. | The numbers say what they do not cover instead of implying benchmark-grade precision. |
| Pseudo-relevance feedback (added here) | `retrieval.prf` mines terms from the lexical leaders of a first pass and searches again with them, weighting each term by how rare it is across the generation so a question asked in other words can reach the passages that use the author's. Off by default. | It is the one lever aimed at the paraphrase gap rather than at candidate depth, and the known-item judged set cannot measure it, so it stays off until the judgments are pooled. |
| Relevance gates with abstention (added here) | Weak candidates are dropped, so a search can legitimately return fewer results than `top_k`, including none. The full-detail payload reports how many candidates each gate rejected. | An honest empty answer beats a confident irrelevant one. |
| Precomputed usability verdict (added here) | The decision "is this candidate structurally unusable?" is computed once when the lookup is built and stored per chunk. | The per-query gate measured 10.3× cheaper without changing a single rejection decision. |
| Lean tool answers (added here) | Each tool returns what it reports: the evidence, the stable handles, the state, and the counts. A field that is empty, null, false, or zero is omitted. `--tool-detail full` is the developer mode and returns the complete service payload. | On a 59-source corpus a six-passage search answers in 10.8 kB instead of 19.8 kB, `status` in 2.8 kB instead of 9.5 kB, and a source listing in 58 kB instead of 149 kB. |
| Per-query freshness opt-out (added here) | A search re-compares the source directory with the generation unless the caller passes `include_staleness=false`; the response then reports `stale=null` instead of a verdict. | That comparison is the only per-query cost that grows with the collection (9.69 ms for 55 sources), so a follow-up search in a live session can skip it. Upgrade reporting is unaffected, because it depends only on the manifest. |

### Project model, review, and durability

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| One project per server process | A `--project-root` defines the boundary; all state lives under `<project>/.research-rag`. | Two projects cannot read each other's documents or indexes. |
| Portable versus derived state | Reviewed decisions (`project.json`, metadata, exclusions, catalog) are portable. Generations, staging, logs, and locks are derived and rebuildable. | You can back up what a human decided, and regenerate the rest. |
| Reviewed inclusions and exclusions | A source can be excluded as a duplicate and later restored. The original file is never deleted or modified. | Review stays reversible, and the server never destroys evidence. |
| Immutable generations | Each build produces a new generation. The active pointer moves only after both indexes validate. | A failed or interrupted build leaves the previous generation searchable. |
| Relocatable derived state | `--runtime-root` puts indexes, staging, and logs on a chosen disk, claimed by a marker naming its owning project. | A project on a slow disk can keep its working files on a fast one, without an OS-level bind mount. |
| Copy-based project portability | A project is self-contained: copying `sources/` plus `.research-rag/` moves it, and `runtime/` rebuilds on the next ingestion. A relocated runtime root is claimed by a marker naming its owning project, so a copy cannot silently share it. | A project can be moved, shared, or archived with ordinary file tools and no export format to version. |

### Interfaces and operational transparency

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Seven focused MCP tools | `status`, `ingest`, `search`, `list_sources`, `get_passage`, `set_source_inclusion`, `set_source_metadata`. | A small, reviewable surface for an agent, instead of upstream's ~78 tools, and every tool is a retrieval operation rather than a state editor. |
| Core command line (added here) | `research-ultra-rag` resolves a project and calls the same `ResearchService` the server exposes, in the caller's own process: `init`, `status`, `ingest`, `search`, `sources`, `passage`, `include`, `exclude`, `metadata`, `config`, `ui`, and `stop`. The UltraRAG gateway is opened on the first call that needs it, so the commands that only read local state never start one. Answers go through the same projector the tools use, and because settings resolve in process, `--set` reaches every operation. | A knowledge base can be created, built, searched, reviewed, browsed, and stopped with no MCP client, no agent, and no long-running server, and the whole surface is scriptable. |
| Local evidence UI | A loopback-only browser workspace over the same seven tools and the same project state, including per-query source include/exclude, category-partition filters, and a partition list with searchable counts. | You can inspect the knowledge base and narrow a search to the works or strands you are working on, without an agent in the loop. |
| UI hosted by the MCP server (added here) | An opt-in `--ui-port` serves that same UI from the MCP server process, reusing its resolved project, runtime root, model cache, and offline settings. `status` reports `ui_url`, `ui_ready`, and `ui_error`; the port is claimed by binding it, so a claim is never handed out twice, a port that cannot be claimed is reported with its reason instead of failing, a released port is claimable again, the UI stops with the server, and a server this project starts for itself refuses to serve one. | The UI and your agent always read the same project state, including when derived state lives on another disk, and there is no second process to clean up. |
| Generated per-project UI launcher (added here) | Initialising a project writes `.research-rag/bin/open-ui.sh` and links it into the project root as `open-ui.sh`. It starts the standalone UI with this project's own root, runtime root, and port, chooses that port while holding a lock, retries the next one when a start fails, records the pid and port only once its own process serves that port, and `--stop` ends the whole process group and sweeps any server of this project that a long build left behind. An existing file or symlink is never overwritten, and `status.ui_launcher` reports the state. | Starting the browser UI for a project is one command with no flags to remember, and the agent's project state and the browser's cannot silently diverge. |
| Version reporting (added here) | `status.version` gives the version the running server started with, the version installed in the environment now, the pinned browser-UI version, and a `restart_required` flag; the browser UI shows the server and UI versions in its header. | Whether the process answering you is the code you just installed is otherwise invisible, which is exactly how an update appears not to have applied. |
| One-command update (added here) | `scripts/update.sh` pulls, syncs the environment, optionally restarts a named project's UI, and reports the remaining step. | Updating stops being a remembered sequence, and the tool says plainly that a stdio server must be restarted by its client rather than pretending it can hot-reload. |
| Terminal verifier | A read-only status and search check, with optional ingestion and forced recomputation. | Fast confidence that an installation works, and a scriptable smoke test. |
| Considerate scheduling (added here) | `runtime.nice` raises this process's CPU niceness once at start, and every child inherits it, so the vanilla gateway, its extractor and retriever children, and every model thread below them yield together. `0` by default, so nothing changes until it is asked for. | A build that saturates eight cores for a quarter of an hour makes the machine you are working on unusable, and priority is the lever that costs no throughput. |
| Server lifetime tied to its owner (added here) | Every child this project spawns is told which process started it, and `watch_owner()` ends a server whose owner is gone, polled from a daemon thread so a build that is busy in one phase cannot miss it. | A leaked build keeps a quarter of an hour of work running for nobody, holds the runtime a later UI needs, and can leave a gateway process behind it. |

| Staleness, upgrade, and retained-generation reporting | `status` says whether the selected generation is stale, and why, whether a policy upgrade is required, and what the retained generations occupy on disk as a count and a total; `--tool-detail full` lists each one, including any whose manifest is unreadable. | You know when a search is answering from older material, and you can see what the retained generations cost without a shell command, while a routine status answer stays a statement about the generation you are searching. |
| Build metrics and failure records | Phase timings, reuse counts, rejection counts, and truncation totals are recorded per generation; non-resumable failures leave a small record. | Slow or surprising builds can be diagnosed without guessing. |
| Documented performance characteristics | Measured, reproducible numbers for index builds, durability writes, embedding, and the query gate, plus retrieval quality against a judged query set, and a benchmark script to reproduce them on your hardware. | Claims can be checked instead of trusted. |

## 3. What this server deliberately does not do

These are choices, not missing pieces. Each one would change what the server is:

- **It does not generate answers.** It returns evidence candidates with provenance; the agent and the researcher interpret them.
- **It does not provide quote-safe transcripts.** Returned text is cleaned for retrieval, so it is never a transcript and never safe to quote; the tool description says that once, and the per-passage flag stays in the full-detail payload. Open the original.
- **It does not decide what is true, and never deletes or excludes sources on its own.** Duplicate and metadata decisions are reviewed and reversible.
- **It does not run OCR.** Scanned PDFs need OCR first; password-protected PDFs are rejected.
- **It is English by default, not by design.** Extraction is language-neutral, and the two stages that depend on language are settings: `language.corpus` names the corpus languages — one, or several for a mixed corpus, with `language.bm25_stopwords` choosing the single list BM25 filters — and `dense.embedding_model` chooses the embedding model, with a German-native model and a multilingual one that covers a mixed corpus in the pinned table. The default stays English, retrieval quality has not been measured on another language yet, and a corpus language the chosen model does not cover is reported by `status`.
- **It does not require an external service.** No hosted embedding API, no vector database server, no credentials. Models are downloaded once and cached locally.
- **It exposes no MCP resources.** Its surface is tools, with the local UI covering human inspection.
- **It does not cache freshness.** A directory signature cannot see a source replaced in place, so a cached verdict could call a changed corpus current. Callers opt out of the check explicitly instead, and the response then reports `stale: null`.

## 4. Planned additions

Deferred work is tracked in two places and not repeated here: `TODO.md` lists the open work inside this repository's scope, and `ROADMAP.md` lists product ideas that are not in scope yet. Nothing in either is claimed as present.

## 5. Comparison with another MCP RAG server

The comparison below is with [`mcp-rag-server`](https://github.com/kwanLeeFrmVi/mcp-rag-server), a general-purpose RAG server written in TypeScript. It is a different tool for a different job, and it is deliberately *not* part of this collection: this repository's collection-level comparison covers its own sibling servers only.

Read this as two profiles rather than a scoreboard. It reflects that project's README at the time of writing; check its repository for the current state.

| Aspect | This server | `mcp-rag-server` |
|---|---|---|
| What it is for | Research evidence over scholarly PDF and EPUB collections, with provenance you can check | General RAG context for an LLM, over plain text files |
| Language and install | Python, `uv sync --frozen` from this repository | Node.js, `npm install -g mcp-rag-server` or `npx` |
| Document formats | Regular `.pdf` and `.epub` only | `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv` |
| Chunking | UltraRAG GPT-2 token chunking, configurable size and overlap | Character count (`CHUNK_SIZE`, default 500) |
| Embeddings | FastEmbed CPU model pinned by revision, downloaded once, no service needed | An external embedding API (OpenAI, Ollama, Granite, or Nomic) over HTTP, Ollama by default |
| Retrieval | BM25, dense, and hybrid, with metadata filters, reranking, and relevance gates that can abstain | Dense nearest-chunk retrieval, top `k` default 15 |
| Dense store | The generation's portable vectors scanned exactly, or an embedded index above a size threshold | Local SQLite vector store (LangChain `LibSQLVectorStore`) |
| Metadata, citations, locators | Resolved title, authors, year, DOI with per-field provenance and warnings in the full-detail payload, plus original-file locators and a reviewed-metadata overlay | Not part of the documented feature set |
| Index lifecycle | Immutable generations, validated before activation, resumable builds, reusable per-document and per-chunk work | Sequential indexing with progress reporting, plus per-document and whole-index removal |
| Cancellation and restart behaviour | Checkpointed: a build resumes where it stopped | Progress is reported; resumability is not documented |
| Interface | Six tools, a local evidence UI, and a terminal verifier; no MCP resources | Five tools and four MCP resources (`rag://documents`, `rag://document/{path}`, `rag://query-document/{chunks}/{query}`, `rag://embedding/status`) |
| Human review | Reviewed metadata corrections and reversible exclusions in the UI | Not part of the documented feature set |
| Retrieval evaluation | Measured: 32 known-item judged queries on one reference corpus, reported per mode and per query class, with pooled recall still pending | Not part of the documented feature set |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 for this repository's own code, which is recorded in `NOTICE` | MIT |

Which to choose:

- **Choose `mcp-rag-server`** if you want the shortest path from "I have notes in Markdown or CSV" to "my LLM can see them" — a single `npx` command, an existing Ollama or hosted embedding endpoint, and no concept of projects, generations, or citations to learn.
- **Choose this server** if your material is PDFs and EPUBs, if you need to cite and verify what you found, if you want the knowledge base to survive interruption and updates without being rebuilt by hand, and if you would rather not depend on an external embedding service.
- **Use both** if that is what the work needs. They share no state and can run side by side: one for quick text context, one for a citable document collection.
