"""Named dependency checks for one project, read by `status` and by the doctor.

Every check reads. Nothing here starts a process, opens a network connection, or
writes to the project, so the whole report can be produced before the first tool
call has decided to start the vanilla gateway.

A check states one of four conditions:

- `ok`: there is nothing to do.
- `warn`: the server answers, but the answer is worse than it should be.
- `blocked`: the server cannot do its job until this is acted on.
- `unknown`: this check did not run. It is never healthy, and the doctor names
  every check that did not run, so "not checked" cannot be read as "fine".

The two model tables are two checks. A missing embedding model prevents a build
from being dense, and a missing reranker only removes the ranking that every
search otherwise applies, so the first can block while the second only degrades.
`degraded` is therefore the list of conditions that reduce an answer without
stopping it, and it is expected when a model is deliberately absent.
