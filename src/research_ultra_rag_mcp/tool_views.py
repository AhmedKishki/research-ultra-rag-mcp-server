"""Projections from service payloads to MCP tool answers.

Every tool answers with the lean projection, which `present_tool_response`
applies. `--tool-detail full` is the developer detail mode: it returns the
service payload unchanged, for debugging retrieval and ingestion.

One rule decides what a lean answer carries: a field is here when a caller can
act on it or could not otherwise account for it. `stale`, a blocker, a filter
that removed every source, and a reranker that did not run are all things a
caller must know about; the query it sent, the timing, the scores that ordered
the passages, and the counts it could make for itself are not. A field whose
value is the ordinary case is left out, so the answer says what happened rather
than what is usual.

A status answer is the strictest case of that rule, because an agent reads it
before anything else: it is a verdict and the work the verdict implies. `ready`
and `stale` are stated as booleans rather than by their absence, `requires`
names the calls that close the gap, and every other field a terminal or the
workspace needs is not here.
