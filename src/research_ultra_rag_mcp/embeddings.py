"""The embedding models this server can drive, each pinned to a revision.

The embedding model decides what the dense half of retrieval can match, so it is
a setting rather than a constant — and it is a setting whose value is checked:
every entry declares the languages it covers, and a corpus in a language the
model was not trained for is reported instead of being silently mis-embedded.

FastEmbed resolves a name to whatever the hub serves that day, so each entry pins
the revision its weights were resolved to, exactly as the reranker table does. A
model that is not in this table is refused.

Two facts travel with a model and are easy to get wrong by hand: its vector
dimension, which the index and every stored vector depend on, and any prefix its
training requires on a query or a passage. FastEmbed does not apply those
prefixes itself, so a model that needs them declares them here and the dense
backends add them.
