"""The reranker models this server can drive, each pinned to a revision.

The reranker is an engine setting, not a tool parameter: every search the server
answers is reranked, and *which* model reranks it is decided here. That is what
lets the harness measure one model against another over the same judged queries
while an agent sees one fixed behavior.

Every name is also a FastEmbed cross-encoder registry name, which is what makes
a choice portable: the name resolves to the same weights inside the shared model
cache, and FastEmbed rejects anything it does not recognize.
